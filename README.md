## Philosophy

This marketplace features plugins that embody **compounding engineering**: each unit of engineering work makes subsequent units of work easier—not harder.

Every plugin follows the four-step process:
1. **Plan** → Break down tasks with clear steps
2. **Delegate** → Execute with AI assistance
3. **Assess** → Test thoroughly and verify quality
4. **Codify** → Record learnings for next time
